Machine learning Application in identifying Bone Fracture Type

Student Name: - Zeid Eljadid Elmajali


Motivation

The motivation for doing this project was primarily an interest in undertaking a challenging project in an interesting area of research. The opportunity to learn about a new area of computing not covered in lectures was appealing. This area is possibly an area that I might study at postgraduate level.

Problem Definition

Bone fractures are one of the most common injuries nowadays. Every year, around 200 thousand fractures occurs in Jordan, an incredible number of people suffers from this disorder and the implications of an untreated fracture may lead to permanent damage or even death. A great responsibility for this lies with the doctors, who have to evaluate tens of X-ray images a day. The technology utilized for first diagnosis is mostly X-ray, which is a modality that has been used for more than one hundred years and it is still frequently used, it is challenging for doctors to evaluate X-ray images: 
1)	firstly, X-ray could hide certain particularities of the bone.
2)	a lot of experience is needed to correctly classify different types of fractures.
3)	doctors have often to act in emergency situations and may be constrained by fatigue.

In that context, my system will be able to help doctors might have a direct impact in the outcome of the patients.

Project-specific objectives 

The objective of this project is to make a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) System to help the doctors to be able to evaluate X-ray images much faster than the traditional way, by filling the software with X-ray images and after a short time the software will be able to evaluate the X-ray image by giving you the type of the fracture and where its located by integrating the modern technique of Image processing and it’s called convolutional neural network (CNN).

project expected outcome

As a university student I expect a lot of outcomes from this project through benefiting a lot of sources, like: -

	Doctors: - It will be much easier than the traditional technique to diagnose and evaluate the statues of the X-ray images through the computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system.

	Patients: - They don’t have to spend their time waiting in Queues for the doctors to diagnose their X-ray images, all they have to do is inputting their X-ray images into the System and it will evaluate their type of fracture.

	University: - as I will be doing this project in the name of my university, it will for sure help my university with the educational purposes, and hopefully it will be published in the Global and local journals to enhance the reputation of the university.

Solution proposal

To the best of my knowledge, there is many types of bone fractures in the human body, so it will be hard to make a system that covers the whole human body’s types of fractures, but it’s not impossible at the same time.

I will be collecting a lot of dataset of X-ray images for the past 6 months from Jordanian Royal Medical Services, and implement it into the System, and we need to feed the system with dataset as much as we can so it could be almost-perfectly accurate, also with using the latest image processing technique (CNN) it will help the project to be even more accurate.

And finally we implement it with a three-layer neural network, in order to achieve the required minimum error value, so the learning rate could be monitored and adjusted, consequently, during various experiments.
